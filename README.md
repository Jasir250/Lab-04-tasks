# Some Notes

The program in answer 5 is working on VS code but not on online compilers. I am not sure what is happening with it.\
When taking a char input for the operator getchar() was not working and scanf() only worked if a space was added before the format specifier\ 
For example: 
* scanf("%c", operator);  // Doesn't work
* scanf(" %c", operator):  // Works fine
